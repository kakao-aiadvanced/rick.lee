Reducing\\nthe number of LoRA layers or using activation recomputation could harm the\\nfine-tuning performance or increase the computational overhead. In this work,\\nwe present LoRA-FA, a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that reduces the\\nactivation memory without performance degradation and expensive recomputation.\\nLoRA-FA chooses to freeze the projection-down weight of $A$ and update the\\nprojection-up weight of $B$ in each LoRA layer. It ensures the change of model\\nweight reside in a low-rank space during LLMs fine-tuning, while eliminating\\nthe requirement to store full-rank input activations. We conduct extensive\\nexperiments across multiple model types (RoBERTa, T5, LLaMA) and model scales.\\nOur results show that LoRA-FA can always achieve close fine-tuning accuracy\\nacross different tasks compared to full parameter fine-tuning and LoRA.\\nFurthermore, LoRA-FA can reduce the overall memory cost by up to 1.4$\\\\times$\\ncompared to LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-04-29\\nTitle: LoRA Land: 310 Fine-tuned LLMs that Rival GPT-4, A Technical Report\\nAuthors: Justin Zhao, Timothy Wang, Wael Abid, Geoffrey Angus, Arnav Garg, Jeffery Kinnison, Alex Sherstinsky, Piero Molino, Travis Addair, Devvret Rishi\\nSummary: Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted\\nmethods for Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs). LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters and memory usage while\\nachieving comparable performance to full fine-tuning. We aim to assess the\\nviability of training and serving LLMs fine-tuned with LoRA in real-world\\napplications. First, we measure the quality of LLMs fine-tuned with quantized\\nlow rank adapters across 10 base models and 31 tasks for a total of 310 models.\\nWe find that 4-bit LoRA fine-tuned models outperform base models by 34 points\\nand GPT-4 by 10 points on average. Second, we investigate the most effective\\nbase models for fine-tuning and assess the correlative and predictive\\ncapacities of task complexity heuristics in forecasting the outcomes of\\nfine-tuning. Finally, we evaluate the latency and concurrency capabilities of\\nLoRAX, an open-source Multi-LoRA inference server that facilitates the\\ndeployment of multiple LoRA fine-tuned models on a single GPU using shared base\\nmodel weights and dynamic adapter loading. LoRAX powers LoRA Land, a web\\napplication that hosts 25 LoRA fine-tuned Mistral-7B LLMs on a single NVIDIA\\nA100 GPU with 80GB memory. LoRA Land highlights the quality and\\ncost-effectiveness of employing multiple specialized LLMs over a single,\\ngeneral-purpose LLM.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-01-08\\nTitle: Chain of LoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models via Residual Learning\\nAuthors: Wenhan Xia, Chengwei Qin, Elad Hazan\\nSummary: Fine-tuning is the primary methodology for tailoring pre-trained large\\nlanguage models to specific tasks. As the model's scale and the diversity of\\ntasks expand, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods are of paramount\\nimportance. One of the most widely used family of methods is low-rank\\nadaptation (LoRA) and its variants. LoRA encodes weight update as the product\\nof two low-rank matrices. Despite its advantages, LoRA falls short of\\nfull-parameter fine-tuning in terms of generalization error for certain tasks.\\n  We introduce Chain of LoRA (COLA), an iterative optimization framework\\ninspired by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, to bridge the gap between LoRA and full\\nparameter fine-tuning, without incurring additional computational costs or\\nmemory overheads. COLA employs a residual learning procedure where it merges\\nlearned LoRA modules into the p\""
